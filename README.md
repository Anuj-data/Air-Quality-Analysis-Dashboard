# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis Dashboard

---

### 📖 Introduction  
This repository hosts my **Air Quality Analysis Dashboard**, created using Power BI. It provides a comprehensive analysis of air quality metrics across different geographic locations using data sourced from [data.gov](https://data.gov).

---

### 📝 Background  
The primary goal of this project is to assess air quality trends over time and across regions. It helps identify pollution hotspots and areas with cleaner air, supporting environmental initiatives and raising awareness. 🌱

---

### 🛠️ Tools I Used  
- **📂 Data Source:** CSV files from [data.gov](https://data.gov)  
- **📊 Visualization:** Power BI   

---

### 📈 Key Metrics and DAX Queries  
- **📌 Metrics:**  
  - 🌡️ Average Air Quality Index (AQI)  
  - 🌆 Highest and lowest pollutant levels by location  
  - 📅 Annual trends in air quality data  

- **💻 DAX Queries:**  
  Specific DAX formulas used for calculations, such as:  
  - `CALCULATE(SUM([DataValue]), YEAR([Date])=2024)`
